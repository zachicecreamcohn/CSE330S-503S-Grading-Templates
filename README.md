# Grading Templates

Please use the markdown grading templates in this repo to provide feedback to students. You should create a new branch called `grading` and paste the relevant template into their README.md.

## Purpose 
The purpose of the grading templates is to provide a consistent grading experience for students. This will help students understand what is expected of them and how they are being graded. It will also help graders provide consistent feedback to students.
